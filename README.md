1. I would not use a unit test to examine a message feature because the message feature will likely have many moving parts in order to send a message quickly and securely between multiple users. Therefore, it will not be easy to isolate the source of the problem using a unit test. 
2. I would use a unit test to examine the max message length features, as it is easy to implement, with only one check for messages longer than 80 characters.
